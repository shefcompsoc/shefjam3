# FAQ

### Do I have to be a member of CompSoc?
Non-members can come as well, but non-members tickets are more expensive.

### What do I need to bring?
You'll need to bring a laptop (and its charger), with all the tools you need installed. You can also bring graphics tablets, small midi controllers, and some cold drinks and snacks.

### But I can’t program.
You don’t have to! You could team up with someone who can program, and your strengths in other fields, such as music or graphics can improve the game. There are also some free game engines which require very little programming knowledge, such as Construct 2 and GameMaker: Studio.

### But I’ve never made a game before.
Make one now! Start with something simple, there a lots of tutorials available for any game engine or library you choose, see our recommendations list below.

### I’m a Hallam Student / UoS Alumni / Non-Student, can I come?
Yes you can! You will have to buy a non-members ticket, which will cost a bit more.

### I don’t have any / enough team members, what should I do?
You can contact others on our Slack channel, or talk to people on the day of the event to team up. Alternatively you could enter solo, we have given awards to soloists in the past..

### What happens to our games after the jam?
You retain full ownership of whatever you create. We can host it for you or if you make it public (on Github, etc.), we will publicise it on our site.

### How many team members can we have?
There is no limit. However, smaller teams make management easier. We can only award up to 5 prizes per team.
