# Rules

### We will be following fairly standard game jam rules, which are designed to inspire creativity:

1. **You can use any tools you want**, including proprietary and custom made ones. You could even make your own level editor to prepare for the jam.

2. **Premade assets (graphics, music, etc.) can be used, provided they are openly available.** You must declare that you used them and you won't be eligible for prizes related to fields which you used assets for. (For example, you won't be eligible for the graphics prize if you used an open 3D model.) We encourage you to make your own assets if you can, even if they don't look like they're from a AAA game.

3. **Any code used in the game that was not written during the jam must be publicly available**, for example, libraries such as OpenFL and LWJGL are allowed.

4. **The theme should be followed**, but does not need to be followed strictly. Try to find a unique interpretation of the theme if you can.

5. Due to prize limitations, **only up to 5 prizes will be available for each category**, so if your team has more than 5 members, you will have to split the prizes between yourselves.
