# Resources

These are some free game dev resources we believe to be use, yet you can use whatever tools suit you. We recommend trying out any tools and languages which you aren’t familiar with before the jam.

### Game Engines
- [Construct 2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2) and [GameMaker: Studio](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) are both great engines for non-programmers.
- [Haxe](http://haxe.org)-based engines, [HaxeFlixel](http://haxeflixel.com) and [HaxePunk](http://haxepunk.com) are both excellent choices for Computer Science students, as Haxe has many similarities to Java, and is able to deploy to many targets. Both engines also boast controller support.
- [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html) is a great option for those who are most familiar with Python.
- [Unity](https://unity3d.com) is probably the best option for 3D games in game jams, and you can also make 2D games in it.

### Graphics
- [aseprite](http://www.aseprite.org) is an excellent animated pixel-art editor. The newest version costs money, but there’s a [free older version](http://www.aseprite.org/older-versions/) available. That version can be a bit buggy, so be sure to save often.
- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) is a professional free and open source painting program. It is made by artists that want to see affordable art tools for everyone.
- [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html) and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) are both good free alternatives to Photoshop. Paint.NET's UI is a bit more user-friendly, though.
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org) is the best free 3D modelling software available.
- [OpenGameArt.Org](http://opengameart.org) provides open game assets. Note the second rule if you do use this, however.

### Audio
- [Bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net) [sfxr](an iteration on (http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)) can randomly generate and tweak various types of sound effects.
- [Bosca Ceoil](http://boscaceoil.net) is an excellent simple music editor made by Terry Cavanagh, the developer of Super Hexagon and VVVVVV. It uses pre-made instruments so you can spend more time composing rather than designing sounds.
- [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org) is a good audio editor, use it to cut silence from and compress files generated by the other tools. Make sure to get the [LAME plugin](http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html#lame) if you want to export MP3s.
- For the hardcore musicians and sound engineers, [LMMS](https://lmms.io) is a free DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), if you don't have something like FL Studio or Ableton.

### Other
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) is excellent version control software, and is essential if you're working in a team. Ensure you and your team know how to use it, and set up a repository beforehand. This **will** save your team if you accidentally break your game, as you can just jump back to an old version.
- [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org) and [Ogmo](http://www.ogmoeditor.com) are both good tile-based level editors. Make sure you can import their outputs into your workflow before the jam, however. Try looking for a library which adds support for the data files they output.
- [Chronolapse](https://www.chronolapse.com) (Windows) and [glaspe](http://saltares.com/blog/apps-tools/glapse/) (GNU/Linux) both screenshot your desktop at rear intervals, allowing you to make a time-lapse of your game’s development.
- [Pixel Prospector](http://www.pixelprospector.com) - One of the most extensive lists of game dev resources, including information on game design and distribution.
- [itch.io](https://itch.io) is a great site for publishing games, you can even sell your games there. Try publishing your game there after the jam.
- [Ludum Dare (Tools)](http://ludumdare.com/compo/tools/) - Tools recommended by the Ludum Dare game jam.
- [Pocketknives for Game Developers (Reddit Thread)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/18e38t/pocketknives_for_game_developers) - A list of various web-based resources, some parts may be slightly outdated.
